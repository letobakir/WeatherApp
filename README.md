The goal of this application is to enable users to access accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts, facilitating informed decision-making related to outdoor activities, travel plans, and daily routines. This academic project emphasizes the use of modern web technologies, proper data handling, and responsive design principles.

Introduction:
The Weather App is a responsive and interactive web-based application that leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver accurate weather information. The app utilizes an API (Application Programming Interface) to fetch weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric conditions, for a specified location. By visualizing this data in a clear and intuitive manner, the app enables users to make informed decisions based on real-time weather conditions.
